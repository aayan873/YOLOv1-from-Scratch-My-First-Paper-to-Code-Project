# YOLOv1 from scratch (Paper Reproduction)


A full Pytorch implementation of the **YOLOv1 (You look only Once)** object detection model, reproduced from the original paper:

## Motivation
While learning PyTorch and exploring research in Computer Vision, I decided to reproduce **YOLOv1** from scratch to:
- Deepen my understanding of the **YOLO architecture**
- Refine my **PyTorch skills**
- Gain experience translating **research papers into working code**
  
I had previously used pre-built YOLO models for object detection, but this project pushed me to build everything from the ground up.

## Overview 
This project reproduces **YOLOv1**, one of the most influential object detection model, entirely from scratch using PyTorch.
It includes the full model architecure, custom loss function, and data pipeline, the goal was to deeply understand and implemeting a research paper from scratch, which also helped in improving my PyTorch skills

> Training has not been completed due to compute limitations.  
> The code includes a test forward pass and modular structure to support future training and visualization.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `model.py` - Implements the YOLOv1 architecture in PyTorch.
- `loss.py` - Defines the custom YOLOv1 loss function (localization, confidence, and classification).
- `utils.py` - Contains utility functions like IoU calculation, grid transformations, etc.
- `dataset.py` - Placeholder for dataset loading (e.g., Pascal VOC).
- `training.py` - Training pipeline (written but not executed due to compute limitations).
- `inference.py` - Runs inference and visualizes predictions on test images.
- `README.md` - Project overview and documentation (this file).
